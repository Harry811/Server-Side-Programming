            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>During my studies at the Institute of Engineering and Technology, Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya, I've gained a variety of experiences that have expanded my skills in technology, design, and leadership.

</p>
<p>I completed a design internship where I was responsible for creating visuals for marketing campaigns. This internship helped me understand design principles and client collaboration, and gave me hands-on experience with industry-standard design tools.

</p>
<p>To enhance my knowledge of technology, I took a course in machine learning, which covered topics like neural networks, data analysis, and supervised learning. This course allowed me to explore the exciting world of artificial intelligence.

</p>
<p>I also completed a course in web development, where I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This broadened my technical skills and introduced me to building interactive websites.

</p>
<p>I have achieved a 3-star rating on CodeChef, a 5-star rating on HackerRank, and a Master badge on CodeStudio. These coding achievements reflect my problem-solving abilities and my commitment to continuously improving my coding skills.

</p>
<p>These experiences have shaped my approach to technology and design, and I look forward to applying my skills to new challenges and opportunities.

</p>
            <p>I'm currently the Design Head of our college's Entrepreneurship Cell (E-Cell). In this role, I create promotional materials and manage our online presence. It has been a fantastic opportunity to develop leadership skills, work collaboratively with a team, and explore the creative aspects of design.</p>
